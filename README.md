For this project we will be endeavouring to make a basic minecraft clone. It will be procedurally generated and contain at least 3 different types of textured block. and as many of the things we can get done from the list.

#Project Plan
Do lots, Code much!

#Proposed technology
- [ ] C++
- [ ] openGL
- [ ] SDL
- [ ] Unit Testing
- [ ] Automated build tools.

#Marking Scheme
-do less well rather than lots badly.
-use of tools. e.g. Git Travis Ide Documentation etc.
-quality of code.
-implementation of core features.
-extra features added.
-abiltilty of code/engine to be added too.

- [ ] block world 10% 
- [ ] procederal block world 20%

- [ ] player 5%
- [ ] player with gui 10%
- [ ] player with interaction 15%

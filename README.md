# CI224-Sem2 

#Overview
##Team:
- George Vicarey
- Richard Hankins

##what we'd like to implement
This will likely consist of some of the following:-
- [ ] A cube world
- [ ] Procedurally generated terrain.
- [ ] Basic inventory system
- [ ] Entities with pathfinding
- [ ] GUI/HUD
- [ ] Terrain has some form of chunk system
- [ ] Add and Remove blocks
- [ ] Some form of networking
- [ ] First person camera
- [ ] Night and day cycle.
- [ ] Pretty shaders.
- [ ] Audio.
- [ ] Multi user git intergration.
- [ ] Continous intergration
- [ ] Auto build system.
- [ ] Multi-platform

#Project Pitch
For this project we will be endeavouring to make a basic minecraft clone. It will be procedurally generated and contain at least 3 different types of textured block. and as many of the things we can get done from the list.

#Project Plan
Do lots, Code much!

#Proposed technology
- [ ] C++
- [ ] openGL
- [ ] SDL
- [ ] Unit Testing
- [ ] Automated build tools.

#Marking Scheme
- Do less well rather than lots badly.  
  - Implement fewer features fully, rather than all features badly.

- Use of indistry standard tools. 
  - Git - 5%
  - Continuous Integration - 5%
  - Build System - 5%
  - Unit testing - 5%

- Quality of code.
- Abiltilty of code/engine to be added too.

- Working block world 
  - [ ] A basic block world (hard coded) - 10%
  - [ ] A procederal block world  - 20%
  - [ ] A procedural block world with proper data structure - 30%

- Working player
  - [ ] plaer that moves - 5%
  - [ ] player with ygui - 10%
  - [ ] player with interaction - 15%
  - [ ] player with interaction and gui and inventory - 20%

- Working entities 
  - Entities with Basic AI (Just wander aimlessly) - 10%
  - Entities with path finding and goals (can actively attack/find the palyer) - 20%

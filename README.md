##Dependancies
This project uses a few libraries from the get go these are:-
- [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)
- [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)

##Build Instructions  
Currently to build you must run  the gcc command to compile all of src/* into an .exe file. When we implement a Build system the project will be built using `./configure` then `make all`

##Marking Scheme  
**The main aim:**  
*Implement fewer features fully, rather than all features badly.*  
  
This is our marking scheme copied from ProjectBrief.md which we can check off things taht we've achieved to plot our progress so far.
  
**Use of industry standard tools (any apply)**  
  - [x] Git - 5%  
  - [x] Continuous Integration - 5%  
  - [x] Build System - 5%  
  - [ ] Unit testing - 5%  
  
**Quality of code (any apply)**  
  - [x] Clean structure - 5%  
  - [x] Modularity of engine/codebase - 10%  
  - [x] Cross platform build - 10%  
  
**Working block world (only one applies)**  
  - [x] A basic block world (hard coded) - 5%  
  - [x] A procedural block world  - 10%  
  - [x] A block world with data structures (chunks) - 10%
  - [x] A procedural block world with proper data structure - 20%  
  
**Working player (only one applies)**  
  - [x] A player that moves - 5%  
  - [ ] A player with HUD - 10%  
  - [ ] A player with interaction - 15%  
  - [ ] A player with interaction and HUD and inventory - 20%  
  
**Working entities (only one applies)**  
  - [ ] Entities with basic AI (Just wander aimlessly) - 10%  
  - [ ] Entities with path finding and goals (can actively attack/find the player) - 20%
